# List Cycle Check
# Problem
Given a singly linked list, write a function which takes in the first node in a singly linked list and returns a boolean indicating if the linked list contains a "cycle".
A cycle(loop) is when a node's next point actually points back to a previous node in the list. This is also sometimes known as a circularly linked list.
